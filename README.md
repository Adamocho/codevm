# VSCODE VERSION MANAGER

Any vscode version on any *nix

## Short story about the origins of this project


My wrath knew no bounds when I realized that the distribution of linux, which I was using at the time, did not contain a proper vscode package in the package manager's repository of theirs. And I then told to myself "Wouldn't it be nice, if I could have **any version** of vscode at my beck and call?". That's how he idea was born.
